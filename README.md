# About

Salted Caramel, because this app is very salty about you not finishing your tasks. 

Here with your daily dosage of dissociation and insults

## Things to do

- [ ] async storage
- [ ] notifs
- [ ] ?? do we need redux for this

## Instructions

* Clone the repository
* Run `npm install`
* Install the [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.io/)
* Either 
    * Install the expo app on your phone
    * Use an android/ios simulator (the code should mostly work for both rn)
* Run `npm start` or `expo start`. 
* A server will start at port 19002. Scan the QR code and open it in the Expo app, or click on one of the "Run on xxx emulator/simulator" options
